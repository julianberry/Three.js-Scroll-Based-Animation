# Three.js Scroll Based Animation/Portfolio Site Outline
## Overview
This portfolio site shell was built based on Bruno Simon's "Three.js Journey" tutorial. This project focuses on scroll based animation and explores the options for incorporating Three.js into a more traditional website. It features several primitive 3D shapes, particles, and parallax effects.

## Features
* Primitive 3D shapes to demonstrate how Three.js can be incorporated into traditional sites
* Parallax effects with gentle easing reacting to scroll and mouse movement
* Background particles to add depth
* Four distinct sections for portfolio, projects, certifications, and contact information
* Rotation of 3D shapes upon scrolling to their respective section
* Material color adjustment within the GUI
* Cell-shaded material style

## Built With
* Three.js
* JavaScript
* GSAP
* Vite
* HTML & CSS

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/julianberry/Scroll-Based-Animation.git
cd Scroll-Based-Animation
npm install
npm run dev
```
## Learning Objectives
* Learn how to integrate Three.js into a standard multi-section website layout.
* Understand the principles behind scroll-driven 3D animation and scene transitions.
* Using GSAP to animate Three.js objects in response to scroll and page events
* Develop intuition for camera movement, parallax, and easing in interactive scenes.
* Experiment with materials, lighting, and stylized rendering in a performance-aware way.
